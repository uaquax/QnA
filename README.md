## UI
* UI should look like a messanger.

* UI should contain a side bar, a text box, and the messages box.

* The bot's avatar and real person's avatar should look differently.



## Ready answers
1 After user asked a question, we need to analyse it with a neural network to extract the main information.

2 Then, we need to search the answers database by keywords, for existing answer.

3 Then we need to send user possible answers and user can select one of them as an actual answer, or ask a real person.

    3.1 If a person chooses an answer as correct one,
        we connect their message with the answer for a more accurate search in the future.
